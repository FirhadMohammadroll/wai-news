<p>The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> has published an updated Working Draft of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/saur/">Synchronization Accessibility User Requirements</a>. This document received valuable comments following publication of its <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-saur-20210928/">First Public Working Draft (FPWD)</a> in September 2021. The results of those comments
are now incorporated in this wide review draft in order that we
may surface any remaining issues that should be addressed before this document
is finalized and published as a W3C Note.

<p>The SAUR summarizes relevant research, then outlines accessibility-related user needs and associated requirements for the synchronization of accessibility-related components of multimedia, such as captions, sign language interpretation, and descriptions. Comments are welcome through <b>13 May 2022</b>.
