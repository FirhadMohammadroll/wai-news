<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> has published  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/remote-meetings/">Accessibility of Remote Meetings</a> as a W3C Group Note. Remote meeting is an umbrella term used to describe real-time discussions or presentations held between two or more parties online. The issues faced by people with disabilities will vary depending on the implementation of accessibility requirements and current limitations of remote meeting software. While W3C has applicable guidance across several standards and Notes relating to real-time communication and XR, it is this level of complexity that this document endeavours to address.
