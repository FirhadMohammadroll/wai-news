title: "New Resource: Cognitive Accessibility Design Patterns Available as a Web Resource"

The cognitive accessibility objectives and design patterns are now available as an interactive [web resource](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/#cognitiveaccessibilityguidance). This multi-page format will be easier for some people to use than the long document form. 

The objectives and design patterns are provided as supplemental guidance to WCAG 2 as described in the [about page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/about/). It is part of the W3C WAI [Cognitive Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/2) work.
