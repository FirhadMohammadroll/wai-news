[WAI-ARIA 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-wai-aria-1.2-20230606) is now a W3C Recommendation. The specification has obtained support from the w3C Members, the W3C Director, and the public, which makes it an official web standard.

Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures, and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup. This version adds features new since WAI-ARIA 1.1 to improve interoperability with assistive technologies to form a more consistent accessibility model for HTML and VG2]. This specification complements both HTML and SVG2.

This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the WAI-ARIA Overview.
