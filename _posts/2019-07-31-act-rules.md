The [Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/) has been published as a W3C Proposed Recommendation.

It specifies a common format for accessibility test rules. [Examples of ACT Rules {% include_cached external.html %}](https://act-rules.github.io/rules/) written in accordance with this specification are continuously developed by the W3C [ACT Rules Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/act-r/) (previously called Auto-WCAG Community Group).
