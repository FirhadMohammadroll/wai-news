A new set of WCAG 2 <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/">Supplemental Guidance pages</a> on the WAI website provide the Objectives and Patterns 
from the Working Group Note <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a>.
This multi-page format will be easier for some people to use than the long document form. Such "supplemental guidance" is advice beyond the requirements of WCAG 2. It is not required for conformance to WCAG.
This is part of the W3C <a href=https://www.w3.org/WAI/cognitive/2>Cognitve Accessibility</a> work .
